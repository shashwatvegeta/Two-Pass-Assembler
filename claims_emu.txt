*****************************************************************************/

Files:
==========
*All the files I submitted, emu.cpp and claims_emu.txt, have my name and student id at the start, along with a declaration of 
authorship.

* Files included are , emulator.cpp, mybubblesort.o ,test4.o ,test4.asm ,MyBubbleSort.asm

Compilation instructions:
=========================
	
	g++ -o emu emu.cpp -std=c++11
	./emu.exe     

	It will ask you for the filename first save the file in same folder as emu.cpp then give the name in .o format
	After that a Menu driven program will offer you different type of instructions.

Assumptions:
============
    * Mnemonic named “data” is always used at the end of assembly code.
    * In trace, printed register values(or SP or PC) are values after execution of the current line

NOTE:
=====
	* Every claim about assembler is already submitted and it satisfies here too (for emulator)
	* all the commands work as mentioned above.

The emulator: 
=============
(some files which were tested)
1. test4.o
	compiles successfully with all functionalities working as mentioned above

2. MyBubbleSort.o
