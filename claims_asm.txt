Files:
==========
All the files that I am submitting ( assembler.cpp and claims_asm.txt), have my name and student roll number at the start, along with a declaration of authorship.

The evidence for Assembler including the output files from the four test examples given (test1 to test4) and bubblesort has also been uploaded. 
They are test1(3 output files), test2(1 output file), test3(3 output files), test4(3 output files) and myBubbleSort(3 output files)
 and one additional test (with output files). 
All the test files have been tested and work properly. 


Compilation instructions:
=========================

    g++ -std=c++11 asm.cpp -o asm
    ./asm file_name 

    * You need to create an asm file naming "test.asm" and run ./asm file_name
    * Ouput files - if there are errors then file_name.log and if there are no errors then file_name.o file, file_name.lst,file_name.log file


Assumptions:
============
    * Mnemonic named “data” is always used at the end of assembly code.
    * Listing file (.lst) and Object file(.o) are generated only when there are no errors in the input Assembly code,  
      otherwise only Error file (.log) is generated.


=============================
Program format and structure:
=============================
1. The assembler:

    * It is a 2 pass assembler (implemented in assembler.cpp)    
    * Every instruction is implemented.
    * outputs the required correct information in the form of three files
    *  .log file for errors and warnings
    *  .lst file for listing 
    *  .o file for machine code object
    
    * Consistent and sensible formatting with sensible program structure. 
    * sensible variable, function & type names with explanatory comments.
    * Advanced listing file gets generated. (named listingfile.lst)
    * Assembles test programs (all 5 test cases including bubble sort).
    * Machine code object file gets generated (named file_name.o)
    * All important errors are diagnosed and corresponding error file gets generated (named file_name.log)
    * SET instruction is also implemented (which carries extra marks).
    * Code is written in C++ with best time complexity.
    * Additional test case with outputs is also included in submission.

    * While copying some testcases i got space betwen lines so for some testcases k=line numbers might differ
    * Also while putting in listing file i put the values by converting to decimal

Testing:
=============================

1. The assembler:

I have tested  five given examples(5 test files) shown as bellow. 
The errors only occurred in the file test2.asm and the program immediately stopped and all errors were put in .log files. 

The others were tested without any errors detected and produced three output files, listing file, 
error log file and machine readable object file, for each example.

1)
#Input: test1.asm
#Output: 
a. test1.lst 
b. test1.log (without any error messages)
c. test1.o

2)
#Input: test2.asm
#Output: 
a. test2.log (with error messages)


3)
#Input:asm test3.asm
#Output: 
a. test3.lst 
b. test3.log (without any error messages)
c. test3.o

4)
#Input: test4.asm
#Output: 
a. test4.lst 
b. test4.log (without any error messages)
c. test4.o

5)
#Input:MyBubbleSort.asm
#Output: 
a. MyBubbleSort.lst 
b. MyBubbleSort.log (without any error messages)
c. MyBubbleSort.o

I have tested  five examples(4 test files) shown as bellow. 
The errors only occurred in the file test2.asm and the program immediately stopped and all errors were put in .log files. 

The others were tested without any errors detected and produced three output files, listing file, 
error log file and machine readable object file, for each example.

1)
#Input: test5.asm
#Output: 
a. test5.lst 
b. test5.log (without any error messages)
c. test5.o

2)
#Input: test6.asm
#Output: 
a. test6.lst 
b. test6.log (without any error messages)
c. test6.o


3)
#Input:asm test7.asm
#Output: 
a. test7.lst 
b. test7.log (without any error messages)
c. test7.o

4)
#Input: test8.asm
#Output: 
a. test8.lst 
b. test8.log (without any error messages)
c. test8.o
